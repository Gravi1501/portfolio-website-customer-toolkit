      <h2>Executive Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to my IT Supervisor Readiness Web Portfolio. This site was developed as part of my academic capstone for the Information Technology Field Experience course at Cumberland University. 
        It showcases my readiness to lead, mentor, and manage within technical teams by integrating both human-centered leadership practices and structured IT operations.
        The tools and frameworks included here were designed to reflect real-world practices in people management, strategic communication, and technology service delivery.

      <h2>Leadership Vision</h2>
      <p>
        As an aspiring IT Supervisor, I am committed to leading with a strategic mindset, operational clarity, and unwavering ethics. My leadership approach focuses on building resilient teams that
        can respond effectively to change while promoting innovation, integrity, and collaboration. I believe in leading by example—driving accountability, supporting growth,
        and aligning every decision with long-term organizational success. This vision is reflected across the leadership and HR tools presented in this portfolio.

      <h2>Outcome & Career Goals</h2>
      <p>
        The completion of this portfolio represents more than an academic achievement. It is a career readiness platform—a demonstration of my leadership maturity, operational foresight, and IT supervisory skills. 
        It positions me for early-career roles such as Helpdesk Supervisor, Junior IT Manager, or Team Lead, and serves as a long-term tool for ongoing personal branding and job market readiness.
